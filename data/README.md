Data sources
============

`brain.nii.gz` is my T1. I was scanned at the Martinos Center at MGH, somehow I acquired it :)

Resting state is from a single subject from the [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org). Cue the lawyers...

    Data were provided [in part] by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.
